## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security issues by:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainers via GitHub
2. **Private Issue**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature if available
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact repository administrators directly

### 📝 What to Include

Please include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## 🛡️ Security Measures in Place

### **Static Analysis**
- **CodeQL**: Automated security scanning on all pull requests
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability detection
- **License Compliance**: Automated license validation

### **Dependency Management**
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates
- **Pin Dependencies**: Critical dependencies pinned by hash
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of known CVEs

### **CI/CD Security**
- **Least Privilege**: GitHub Actions use minimal required permissions
- **Supply Chain Protection**: All third-party actions pinned by commit hash
- **Secure Workflows**: No dangerous workflow patterns

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **Container Security**: Base images pinned to specific digests
- **AWS IAM**: Least privilege access controls
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications

## ⚡ Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24-48 hours
- **High severity**: 7 days
- **Medium severity**: 30 days
- **Low severity**: Next release cycle

## 🔍 Security Testing

This project undergoes regular security assessments:

- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Monthly comprehensive security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Weekly automated checks
- **Static Analysis**: On every pull request
- **Security Reviews**: Quarterly manual assessments

## 🏛️ Governance

Security decisions follow these principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Zero Trust**: Verify all access and communications
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimum required access permissions
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
5. **Incident Response**: Documented response procedures
