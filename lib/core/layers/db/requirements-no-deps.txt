# Packages installed with --no-deps to avoid pulling unnecessary transitive dependencies.
# - langchain-postgres: pulls psycopg[binary] (~18MB, already in this layer), asyncpg (~14MB)
# - pgvector: pulls numpy (~45MB, already in RAG layer at runtime)
# - opensearch-py: pulls grpcio (~17MB) + opensearch-protobufs via protobuf transport
#   (we only use RequestsHttpConnection, so grpc is not needed)
# Required runtime deps are in requirements.txt or provided by other layers.
