# Packages installed with --no-deps to avoid pulling unnecessary transitive dependencies
# that would push the Lambda layer over the 250MB unzipped size limit.
#
# langchain-community: pulls langchain-classic (~15MB), grpcio (~17MB) via langsmith
#
# Required transitive deps are explicitly listed in requirements.txt instead.
# langchain-postgres moved to DB Layer.
