# Database connectivity layer for PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, and PGVector
# Used by lambdas that need database/vector store access:
# - IamAuthSetupFn (db_setup_iam_auth)
# - ModelApiKeyCleanup (model_api_key_cleanup)
# - RAG lambdas (repository CRUD, similarity search)
#
# NOTE: opensearch-py and pgvector are installed via requirements-no-deps.txt
# to avoid pulling ~65MB of unnecessary transitive deps:
# - pgvector pulls numpy (~45MB, already in RAG layer)
# - opensearch-py 3.1.0 pulls grpcio (~17MB) via opensearch-protobufs
#   (only needed for protobuf transport; we use RequestsHttpConnection)
# Their actual runtime deps (requests, urllib3, certifi, python-dateutil)
# are provided by Common layer or the Lambda runtime.
