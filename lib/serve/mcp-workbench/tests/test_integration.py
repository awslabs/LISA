    TODO: Implement proper FastMCP 2.0 integration tests that:
    1. Start the FastMCP server
    2. Connect via MCP client
    3. Test tool discovery and execution via MCP protocol
    4. Test management tools (rescan_tools, exit_server)

    assert True  # Placeholder - tests pass but indicate work needed


# Note: The previous REST API integration tests have been removed as they are no longer 
# applicable to the pure FastMCP 2.0 architecture. New integration tests should:
#
# 1. Use an MCP client to connect to the server
# 2. Test tool discovery via MCP protocol
# 3. Test tool execution via MCP protocol  
# 4. Test management tools as native MCP tools
#
# This requires either:
# - A proper MCP client implementation
# - Or mocking the MCP protocol for testing
