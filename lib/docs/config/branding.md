# Branding

LISA supports some branding through the deployment [Configuration](/config/configuration). Adding the following
will modify the Chat UI with a custom banner:

```yaml
systemBanner:
  text: LISA System
  backgroundColor: orange
  fontColor: black
```

These values are shared across all users.
