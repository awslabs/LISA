# RAG Lambda Layer - Slimmed down for Lambda 250MB limit
# Document processing dependencies moved to container-based batch ingestion.
# Database/vector store connectors moved to DB Layer.
#
# This layer is used by Lambda functions for:
# - Repository/Collection CRUD operations
# - Similarity search (OpenSearch, PGVector) — via DB Layer
# - Ingestion job management (submitting to Batch, not processing)
#
# NOTE: langchain-community is installed separately via requirements-no-deps.txt
# (with --no-deps) to avoid pulling ~65MB of unnecessary transitive dependencies.
# Its required runtime deps are listed explicitly below.

# Core langchain package for vector store base classes

# Required by langchain-community for vector operations
numpy==2.1.0
